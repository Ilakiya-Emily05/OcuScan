Human Eye Disease Prediction System
The Human Eye Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based diagnostic tool designed to predict the likelihood of various eye-related diseases based on patient health parameters.
Using structured clinical data, the model learns to identify patterns associated with common ocular diseases, enabling faster and more reliable preliminary diagnosis.

Built with Python and scikit-learn, this project demonstrates how machine learning can support healthcare diagnostics by analyzing tabular datasets with features such as patient age, vision test scores, and other biometric indicators.
